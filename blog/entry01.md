# Entry 1: Deciding my topic 
 10/11/25

## The Topic I chose and why 
The topic I decided for my project is graphic design and how it can combine creativity with technology. I chose this topic because i'm interested how on how designers use color,shapes, and images to make people feel emotions or understamd information better. Graphic design is everywhere,in logos,advertisements,websites and even in schools, and i want to understand how it can influence the way people think and learn. I also really like to use my creativity to make things that look appealing and meaningful,choosing this as a topic feels the most like me as i can express myself from making the website itself but also still learning from researching. I was originally interested in psychology and education because i wanted to learn how people's mind works and how they are able to learn new information. Then i realized graphic design connects to both topic, it can influence emotions(psychology) and make learning easier or more engaging (education). I want to explore more on how graphic design impacts the way we learn,remember and reactto visuals. B

## Backup Ideas
My backup ideas were to focus on psychology and education. If i chose psychology, i would have reasearch on how colors,shapes,and fonts affect people's emotions and decision making. A example is why some colors have a positive or negative reaction from people. if i chose education, i would have explored how visuals and design can help studetns understand harder information faster. Even though both ropics are interesting, i decided to focus on graphic design because it connects creativity,technology, and human behavior and its something i could see myself focusing on/actually doing in the future.

## Engineering Design Process 
At the moment, i am in the first stage of the engineering design process, defining the problem.
the problem i want to explore is how graphic design helps people communicate ideas clearly and emotionally using color and layout. i also want to undertand how technology like AI and digital design aoftware has changed the design world,making it easier to create and share art globally. Next, i will continue to research specific design tools like
