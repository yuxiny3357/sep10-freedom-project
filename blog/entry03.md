## Comtext 

For this part of my project, i focused on brainstorming and finalizing the content for part B. I came up with ideas for a possible future technology called the holographic canvas and dream printer. I thought about the problems artists might have now, like not getting the right proportions right or not being able to see their drawings in 3D. Those problems helped me brainstorm features that would make drawing easier and more creative. I imagined a canvas that can project any drawings into 3D and even scan things you've already drawn. It also can add real materials such as watercolor or charcoal and generating textures. The dream printer make it easier for any artist to printer their texure drawings quicker and using less ink. I wanted both device to feel modern and that helps these artists have a easier time when doing their job. After brainstorming these ideas, i chose the features i liked the best and wrote them clearly so they're ready for my website.

## Sources 
To help me brainstorm and complete my ideas, i looked back at the websites and resources i used earlier in the project. I reread articles,notes and any research that hekped me understand my topic better. Even though i didn't use many new sources this time,reviewing my old ones helped me come up with new ideas. These sources helped me stay ob trac and supported the updates i made to my project. I made sure to cite everything properly so readers can see where i got my information.

## Engineering Design Process
Right now, I'm in the brainstorming and planning stage of the engineering design process. I started by researching current digital drawing tools,hologram devices and 3D projection technology to understand what is possible today. Then i identifed problems artists still face, like getting the right proportions, limited materials, and flat screens. After that, iused my research and imagination to come up with new ideas,such as the holographic canvas and dream printer. My next step is to start designing my project and explaning how these devices would work and help artists. 

## Skills
For this project i've had improve skills such as researching  and had to use a new skill creativity. 

* Research skills: I improved my research skills by looking up information about current drawing technology,holograms and digitl materials. I studied how tolls like #D scanners,projectors, and design software devices and used that information to build more realistic features for my devices. This skill helped me understand what already exists and what could be improved in the future.
* Thinking creatively: I learned how to thunk creatively by taking what i already knew about digital art tools and imagining completely new and better versions of them. I thought about problems artists face, like getting proportions right ot needing different textures and used that to create ideas like a holographic canavs and a dream printer. This skill helpedme design tools that are both useful and futuristic.
## Next steps 
My next steps is to start putting my project together. I will use everything I researched and all the ideas i brainstormed to design my holographic canvas and dream printer. I want to explain how each device works and how it helps artists,using clear and simple language. I will also include details about currrent art tools so people can see how my ideas can help improve graphic design.  This step is exciting because i get to bring my ideas to life and show what future art technology could look like.
