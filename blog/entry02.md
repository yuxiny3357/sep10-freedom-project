# Graphic Design Technology
##### 11/03/25


Currently, i'm in the research stage of the engineering design process have many websites and articles about graphic design tools and devices that help the designers. I found a lot of information about software and hardware tools thats use in design. While researching graphic design I learned that designers used both software and hardware to bring ideas to life popular programs like Photoshop illustrator and Canva help create digital art and layout. They also use tool such as drawing tablets and styluses to improve accuracy and creativity. I found these websites by using phrases such as two that's used in graphic design or apps that help graphic designers. I vistied design blogs or websties to gather and compare infotmation.

## Apps 
Graphic designers use different apps to help them create,edit,and improve their designs. These apps i've dound makes design process easier,more creative,and efficient by offering many tools and features for photo editing,layout and digital artwork.

* PicMonkey: Its a designing app and website simliar to canva. Its helos users create designs easily by providing video tutorials on editing ans a page dedicated to graphic design. The app is user friendly and offers many features, from photo editing to advanced graphic designing.
* GIMP: It is a free, advanced photo editing software that includes tools such as layers,masks,filters,and plug ins,its similar to Adobe photoshop. It works on both Windows and macOS and requires only basic hardware. GIMP is popular with photographers and digital artists fot its features.
* Visme: Its an online design and presentation tools that helps users create reports,social media graphics,animations, and more. It is fully cloud-based and offers templates,drag and drop design tools, and collaboration features forteams. Visme works on any device with a web browser and making it more easy and convenient for designers anywhere.

 ## Hardeware/Devices
 Graphic designers also use different types of hardware and devices to help them create and improve their designs. These tools make it easier to draw,edit,store,and transfer their artwork efficiently.
 * Sound Tablet: A sound tablet is a digital drawing tablet that provides vibration or sound feedback to mimic the feeling of drawing on paper. It helps artists achieve a more traditional drawing experience making it easier for them to control strokes and pressure. This device bridges the gal between traditional and digital art,helping designers feel more comfortable while creating.
 * Flatbed Scanner: Its a glass surface thats used to scan and digitize anything on paper. It preserves the details and textures of the original artwork, allowing designers to create high quality digital copies of printed designs. This device he,ps combine traditional and digital techniques,keeping the artwork clear and detailed.
 * External SSD: Its a portable storage device used to store large design files. It helps designers expand their storage capacity,transfer projects quickly,ans work efficiently by loading and saving large files faster. This makes it an essential tool for managing design projects on to go.

 ## Skills
 * Decison making: I practice choosing incredible information by comparing the differences from the evidence and reliability to other websites.
 * Time management: researching took a lot of my time to find apps and websites that weren't well known. I had to set priorities and meet deadline for my other classes on time. This skill help me balance multiple task and to stay organized.

   ## Next Steps
   i'm currently on the second stage of the engineering design process which involves researching current tools in devices that use in graphic design. I want to learn how these tools are created and how they help designers improve their work and create creativity. I'm excited to develop the project to explore technology that supports designers and that help make design processes more efficient and innovative.
